VERSE DESCRIPTION: Psalm 25:4-5
VERSE: Psalm 25:4-5
THOUGHTS: Life can be so confusing. There are so many choices for us as we decide the values that will govern our lives. So how are we going to find the best way, God's way, to live? We will ask God to show us! Our hope is in him. Our salvation is in him. So why not ask him to guide us and teach us his truth? Why not expect that he will make his will known for us? If our hearts are open to his truth and we are seeking his path, he will make his will known.
PRAYER: O mighty God, the only true guide to life, please help me to know your will more completely. I want to live for you and to please you. I want others to know of my allegiance to you &#8212; not just because of the words I speak, but also through the character of my conduct. In Jesus' name I ask it. Amen.
