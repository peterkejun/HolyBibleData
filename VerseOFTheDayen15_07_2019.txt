CONTENT: Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: 1 Timothy 5:3
VERSE: 1 Timothy 5:3
THOUGHTS: Practical loving concern for those who are powerless and forgotten is rooted in the heart of God and championed in Old Testament Law. One of the first internal problems the early church urgently and positively dealt with was prejudice and neglect of the Greek speaking widows in Jerusalem. It was important to God and to them! Paul further reminds us that we better have the same concern for widows today! (Notice that James extends that same concern for both widows and orphans! James 1:27)
PRAYER: Forgive me, loving Father, for I sometimes get so lost in my own opportunities and problems that I don't look around and check on those in my church family who need my help much less those in need who are not Christians. Touch me with your Spirit so that I may better hear, see, and respond to their needs. Thank you for your concern for all people, and please use me as one of your tools of concern to bless those in need. In the precious name of Jesus I pray. Amen.
