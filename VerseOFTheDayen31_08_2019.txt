VERSE: Philemon 1:7
THOUGHTS: Wouldn't this description of Philemon be a great one to have said about you! To be loved, supported, and encouraged by an encourager is to have your heart refreshed and your attitude lifted. Let's make a commitment to be an "encourager" who refreshes the hearts of those around us this week.
PRAYER: Tender and loving God, thank you for leading the people into my life who have encouraged me when I most needed it. Please give me the eyes to see and the heart to serve those around me who desperately need my encouragement. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
