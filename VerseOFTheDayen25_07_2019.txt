CONTENT: Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Titus 2:2
VERSE: Titus 2:2
THOUGHTS: "Teach older men?" "Learn from younger folks?" Buried in this verse is a profound understanding and respect that transcends generations. For some of us who share our local churches with five generations of people for the first time in human history, Paul's challenging words mean even more to us today. Those who are younger need leaders and mentors who are people of character if transformation and renewal are to be sustainable. Those who are older need to realize that God often uses the voices of the young to speak his truth and bring renewal. We need to love, respect, and pray for each other as we seek to be God's people in our time!
PRAYER: O God, please give us wisdom, patience, and respect in your Family so that we may value each person, listen to the voices of character and maturity regardless of age, and be open to hearing your truth no matter who you use to speak it to us. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
