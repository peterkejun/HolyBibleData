VERSE DESCRIPTION: Acts 17:4
VERSE: Acts 17:4
THOUGHTS: Women have always played an important role in the work of God. This was especially true in Macedonia (Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea) in the first century. In each of these places, many of the leading women of the community were touched by the Gospel. We know they played important roles in supporting the missionary enterprise (Lydia) and sharing the Gospel with those around them (Euodia and Syntyche). Why not take time today to let a godly woman in your congregation know how important she is to the Lord's work and to you.
PRAYER: Almighty God, thank you for godly women of faith. Bless them and their service and make it powerful and effective to your glory. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
