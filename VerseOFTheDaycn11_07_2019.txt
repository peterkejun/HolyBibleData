VERSE: Psalm 126:2
THOUGHTS: So many of us are so richly blessed â€” if not by physical and financial blessings, then most definitely by God's gracious spiritual blessings. The Lord has done great things for us! Let's praise him with songs of praise and lives full of laughter and joy!
PRAYER: Generous and gracious Father, thank you so much for the many ways you have blessed me. Your gift of salvation through your Son Jesus is so incredible and gives me hope and confidence for the future. May all the physical and financial blessings you've shared with me bring glory to you, not me! In Jesus' name. Amen.
