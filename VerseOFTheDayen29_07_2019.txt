CONTENT: Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Psalm 71:18
VERSE: Psalm 71:18
THOUGHTS: In the beautiful hymn entitled, "O Sacred Head," the final verse ends with this plea: "Lord, let me never, never, outlive my love to thee." To this sentiment we want to add one other: "Lord, let me never, never, die until the next generation knoweth thee!"
PRAYER: Lord God Almighty, the great I AM, help me and those in my generation to pass on an appreciation of your power and glory to those who come after us. Bless your Church's future with many more continuous generations of faith after me or until that day you send your Son to bring your people home. In the name of my coming Lord, Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.
