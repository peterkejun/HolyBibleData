CONTENT: Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: 1 Timothy 4:12
VERSE: 1 Timothy 4:12
THOUGHTS: How do you command the respect of others when you are young? You don't! You earn that respect by the character and quality of your life. Those of us who are older must recognize and validate younger Christians who are people of character and faith. Those of us who are younger, need to live a life of character that cannot be questioned. Character, morality, faith, and loving kindness are essential attributes of the Christian, no matter his or her age.
PRAYER: Holy God, I thank you for those in our church family who are young and stand for your character and who live godly lives despite pressure from their peers to do otherwise. Father, I also thank you for those who are older in the faith, who have given me a chance to use my gifts and who have influenced and encouraged me in my spiritual growth. Please help us keep our church united in mission and purpose across the different age groups, to your glory and for the growth of your Kingdom. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
