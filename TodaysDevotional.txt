<em>O you my God, save your servant who trusts in you</em>&mdash;Psalm 86:2 (NASB).</p>
<p>In your mercy and love, O God, we are permitted to greet another day. Your guardian angels have watched over us when we have not been able to care for ourselves. Sweet sleep has refreshed us, and now we look into another day confident that you will guide and strengthen.</p>
<p>Help us this day to walk uprightly, that no good thing may be withheld. Forbid that any of us should be careless or indifferent to the opportunities of service that may be ours. May your Word ... be a source of strength and uplift, and may we treasure it more as the days and the years slip by.</p>
<p>God bless the sick and the tempted. Strengthen the weak ones and comfort all who sorrow. Bless our ministers and missionaries and deaconesses, and all who devote their lives specially to the work of your kingdom.</p>
<p>And now, our Father, as we separate for the day&rsquo;s duties, may your loving presence be with us, in our home, and at school, and at business. And at the close of the day may we realize that &ldquo;the trivial round and the common task&rdquo; have indeed brought us nearer you.</p>
<p>We ask all through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
