<em>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</em> &mdash; Matthew 5:10 (ESV).</p>
<p>In declaring this blessedness, our Lord is careful to prevent the idea that persecution in itself confers any promise. It only does so when it is &ldquo;for righteousness&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; The Savior explains his meaning by adding, &ldquo;When men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake.&rdquo; It is not necessary to the idea that the persecution should be open and public, as that of a martyr. There is a petty martyrdom, endured day by day in private, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, which equally may win the crown.</p>
<p>O bountiful Lord Christ, who were yourself persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, help me to endure with your meekness whatsoever persecution you call me to sustain for your cause; and grant to me, that partaking your baptism of fire, I rise with you to your crown of glory, to the praise of your effectual grace.</p>
