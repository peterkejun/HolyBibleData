Let your prayers be about the things that really interest you. The more minute and individualizing a prayer is, the more real it will be. You are coming to One to whom the little and the great are all the same. Nothing is below his sympathy, nothing is above his power. And take care, when prayer is gone up, to look up, David-like, and watch for the arrow&rsquo;s fall. It will fall, feathered with blessing, though the descent and the spot may be very different from what you looked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;The Rev. J. Vaughan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afflictions are blessings when we can bless God for our afflictions. God had one Son without sin, but he never had any without sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Dyer.</p>
