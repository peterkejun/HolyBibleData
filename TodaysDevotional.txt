<em>Even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you</em>&mdash;Isaiah 56:4 (ESV).</p>
<p>What a sweet portion is this for the aged disciples of the Lord Jesus; heart and flesh may fail them, but God will not forsake them. Having begun a good work in them, he will carry it on. His gifts and callings are irrevocable. He will be as kind, as tender, and as gracious at last as at the first. HE WILL CARRY us. The eternal God is our refuge, underneath are the everlasting arms. He will carry us safely through every danger, over every difficulty, into his presence and glory. Aged pilgrim, lean upon your God; look unto him; and as the nurse carries the sucking child, so will your God carry you. He will prove himself faithful to his word, and ultimately call you forth as a witness to the same. Fear not then in reference to the evening of old age: your God will supply you; He will support you; and at last land you safe where the storms of trouble never blow, where weakness and fear are never felt. Take no anxious thought for the morrow; let the morrow take thought for the things of itself; &ldquo;sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof&rdquo; [Matthew 6:34] The promise of your God cannot fail you; He will guide you and carry you to his kingdom and glory. He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Even down to old age, all my people shall prove<br /> My sov&rsquo;reign, eternal, unchangeable love;<br /> And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,<br /> Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.</blockquote>
