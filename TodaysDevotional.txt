<em>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&rdquo;</em> &mdash;John 14:6.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the only and true way to eternal life. &ldquo;No one comes to the Father except by me.&rdquo; His gospel reflects the image of God. It is divine in its origin, free in its communications, satisfying in its effects, constant in its supplies, active in its operations, merciful in its powers, and glorious in its results. It is a system perfectly adapted to the probationary state of man. It is light to the darkness of reason, peace to the tumult of his conscience, joy to the anguish of his soul, and hope to the gloom of his despondency.</p>
<p>Is he guilty?&mdash;it presents a sufficient Savior. Is he polluted?&mdash;it opens to him a fountain to cleanse away his sin. Is he alienated from God?&mdash;here is a medium of approach, a way of access. Is he the victim of ignorance and error?&mdash;here, then, he receives the lessons of a heavenly prophet, and becomes wise to salvation. Does he feel himself the victim of passions which lead him astray? &mdash;here is an example to subdue his passions, to curb his lusts, and to control his will. In every point of view the gospel meets his case. Is he a sinner?&mdash;it offers pardon. Is he a debtor?&mdash;it presents to him the merciful conditions of his discharge. Is he a captive?&mdash;it gives him liberty. Is he an endangered heir of glory?&mdash;it restores him to his throne, and constitutes him a king and priest unto God. Is he thirsty?&mdash;it is a river of life. Is he weary?&mdash;it is a delightful repose. Is he ignorant?&mdash;it is a divine instructor. Is he diseased?&mdash;it is immortal health and vigor to his soul. Is he dying?&mdash;it is eternal life&hellip;.</p>
<p>How uncontrollable the power of the gospel over every one who really receives it! It pierces the conscience; it softens the heart; it purifies the soul. The lover of pleasure hears it, and becomes a lover of God; the thoughtless trifler is struck by it, and, for the first time, begins to reflect and pray; the sensualist, as he listens to its sayings, tears his lusts from his heart; and the man who before loved and served the world turns his back upon it, and tramples its sins and follies underneath his feet, while he fixes his eyes on heaven. Thus has Christ brought thousands to righteousness whom the moral law could not have reclaimed; and thus has he proved his superior glory, by his superior power over the hearts of men.</p>
