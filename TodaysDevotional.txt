<em>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free</em>&mdash;Galatians 5:1 (NIV).</p>
<p>This &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; makes us free to invoke heaven&rsquo;s charter&mdash;the Bible. Here is a choice passage, believer, &ldquo;When you pass through the rivers, I will be with you.&rdquo; You are free to that. Here is another: &ldquo;The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from you&rdquo;; you are free to that. You are a welcome guest at the table of the promises. Scripture is a never-failing treasury filled with boundless stores of grace. It is the bank of heaven; you may draw from it as much as you please, without obstacle or hindrance. Come in faith and you are welcome to all covenant blessings. There is not a promise in the Word which shall be withheld. In the depths of tribulations let this freedom comfort you; amidst waves of distress let it cheer you; when sorrows surround you let it be your solace. This is your Father&rsquo;s love-token; you are free to it at all times.</p>
<p>You are also free to come to the throne of grace. It is the believer&rsquo;s privilege to have access at all times to his heavenly Father. Whatever our desires, our difficulties, our wants, we are at liberty to spread all before him. It matters not how much we may have sinned, we may ask and expect pardon. It signifies nothing how poor we are, we may plead his promise that he will provide all things needful. We have permission to approach his throne at all times--in midnight&rsquo;s darkest hour, or in noontide&rsquo;s most burning heat. Exercise your right, O believer, and live up to your privilege.</p>
<p>You are free to all that is treasured up in Christ&mdash;wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It matters not what your need is, for there is fullness of supply in Christ, and it is there for you. O what a &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; is yours! Freedom from condemnation, freedom to the promises, freedom to the throne of grace, and at last freedom to enter heaven!</p>
