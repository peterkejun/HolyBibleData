It is the heart for which God asks, and, moreover, it is the <em>whole</em> heart. There are many claimants in the world for our heart&rsquo;s affections; but, in withholding our hearts from [worldly things] and giving them to God, we give him our best&mdash;we give him our all, we give him ourselves. Oh, that we might lose ourselves in loving, thorough-going service, and self-dedication!&mdash; O God, save me from half-heartedness&mdash;grant that my heart may be whole with you.</p>
