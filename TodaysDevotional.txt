<em>The righteous shall live by faith</em>&mdash; Romans 1:17 (ESV).</p>
<p>Peter tells us that faith purifies the heart (1 Peter 1:7), and John affirms, &ldquo;this is the victory, whereby we overcome the world, even our faith,&rdquo; (1 John 5:4) and he tells us (1 John 2:16) what he means by <em>the world</em>, even &ldquo;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come, bring your face to the gospel mirror. Does your faith overcome the lust of the flesh, making you victorious over your palate, and over outward pollution and inward uncleanness? Does your faith overcome the lust of the eye and keep your heart from grasping after more wealth, more preferment, or more honor? Having food and raiment, have you with it learned to be content? Does your faith overcome the pride of life and prevent your being charmed with a big house, expensive furniture, the latest gadgets or games, and splendid clothes? Does it make you sick of earthly vanities and draw your heart to things above?</p>
<p>Answer honestly: if you are a slave to these matters, and a quiet slave, you may keep your &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; Satan will not steal it from you. The devils do believe and tremble, but are devils still.</p>
