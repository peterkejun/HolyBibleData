<em>You will indeed drink my cup</em> &mdash; Matthew 20:23 (Berean Bible Study).</p>
<p>Both the sons of Zebedee drank of the cup of persecution. St. James was put to death by the malice of Herod, and was the first of the apostles that gained the crown of martyrdom, cheerfully taking that cup of which he had long since told his Lord that he was most willing to drink. We have nothing whatever except the fact of his death [Acts 12:2]. Not a word of his preaching and his work. God calls us to different labors in the vineyard, some to become famous, some to be forgotten.</p>
