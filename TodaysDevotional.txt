<em>All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure</em> &mdash;1 John 3:3 (NIV).</p>
<p>God is now aiming to reproduce in us the pattern which has already appeared in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The Christian life is not an imitation of Christ, but a direct new creation in Christ, and the union with Christ is so complete that he imparts his own nature to us and lives his own life in us and then it is not an imitation, but simply the outgrowth of the nature implanted within.</p>
<p>We live Christ-like because we have the Christ-life. God is not satisfied with anything less than perfection. He required that from his Son. He requires it from us, and he does not, in the process of grace, reduce the standard, but he brings us up to it. He does not let down the righteousness of the law, but he requires of us a righteousness that far exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, and then he imparts it to us. He counts us righteous in sanctification, and he says of the new creation, &ldquo;you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord, live out your very life in me.</p>
