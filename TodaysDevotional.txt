<em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold all things have become new</em>. 2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV</p>
<p>The object of a New Year is not that we should have a new year. It is that we should have a new soul and a new nose; new feet, a new backbone, new ears, and new eyes. Unless a particular man made New Year resolutions, he would make no resolutions. Unless a man starts fresh about things, he will certainly do nothing effective. Unless a man starts on the strange assumption that he has never existed before, it is quite certain that he will never exist afterward. Unless a man be born again, he shall by no means enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
