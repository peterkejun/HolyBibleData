<em>How blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit!</em>&mdash;Psalm 32:2 (NASB).</p>
<p>Here is the burden of unconfessed sin. &ldquo;When I kept silent <em>about my sin</em>, my body wasted away&rdquo; [Psalm 32:3 NASB]. There is nothing brings on premature age like secret sin. It keeps the mind in perpetual unrest, and a troubled mind soon makes the body old. The real nourisher of the body is a quiet and radiant soul. But let the soul be in chaos, and the body will soon be a ruin.</p>
<p>And here, too, is the healthy act of confession. &ldquo;I acknowledged my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not hide&rdquo; [Psalm 32:5 NASB]. He retained no single germ of the whole unclean brood. He brought them out into the light one by one, as though he were emptying a noisome [stinky] kennel. He brought them out, and named them, in the awful presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>And here is the ministry of forgiveness, and therefore the miracle of restored health. Let me mark the rich variety of the descriptive words. &ldquo;Forgiven!&rdquo; &ldquo;Covered!&rdquo; &ldquo;Imputed not!&rdquo; It is all removed and obliterated, and the place of defilement and profanity becomes the holy temple of the Lord.</p>
