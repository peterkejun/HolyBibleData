<em>Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him</em> &mdash;John 14:21 (ESV).</p>
<p>It is very important that we should know whether or not we do love Jesus Christ; for it is only by the love of him that we can judge of our interest in the merits of his death.</p>
<p>The text gives a plain rule by which we may find out our real state. It is not the <em>having</em> Christ&rsquo;s commandments, having a knowledge of the Bible, or attending in the place of hearing where his commandments are enforced and explained, which will prove a man to love Christ with a saving love; &ldquo;he who keeps my commandments, he it is that loves me,&rdquo; is our Lord&rsquo;s declaration, for &ldquo;love is the fulfilling of the law.&rdquo; Do we keep Christ&rsquo;s commandments as we would keep something precious that we were afraid to lose? Do we treasure them up in our minds as the rule by which all that happens to us must be decided? Do we follow them against the customs and examples of the multitude, as the connection between us and Christ? bringing us into closer communion with him through the Spirit of Truth, by whom Christ manifests himself to those who love him? God grant that we may &ldquo;perfectly love him and worthily magnify his holy name.&rdquo;</p>
