CONTENT: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Mark 10:25
VERSE: Mark 10:25
THOUGHTS: It is so easy to think of ourselves as average people who are not rich. But bottom line, if we have access to a computer to read e-mail, we're richer than most of the world. Let's not let our "stuff" get in the way of our faith and compassion. God wants to help our camels get through the eye of the needle. He will, if we remember that what we have is a gift from him, and that he intends for us to use it to bless others and honor him. 
PRAYER: Tender Father, it is sometimes very hard for me not to worry some about money issues. I know that I am richly blessed and have so many advantages. But Father, I don't want to be owned by the things I possess and I don't want to be sidetracked by trying to acquire what I don't have. Please help me as I seek to be rich in kindness, generosity, and thankfulness with whatever you choose to bless me. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
