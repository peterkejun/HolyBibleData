CONTENT: Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Lamentations 5:21
VERSE: Lamentations 5:21
THOUGHTS: When these words were first spoken, they focused on God's restoration of Israel back to its place, its prominence, its life, and its Temple. Yet from our vantage point, this prayer can be ours as well. Restoration can mean Christ's return which brings us home to God. On that day, every barrier standing between God and us will fall. Our mortality will be swallowed up in victory. We will see God face to face and get to walk with him in the cool of the day as his perfect children. May that day come soon!
PRAYER: Holy and awesome God, I know a huge gulf stands between your perfection and my limitations. Yet, dear Father, I believe you have spanned that gulf with your grace. While I wait for that perfection to dawn in all its fullness, please empower me for my battles with the Evil One and deliver me from all spiritual harm and attack. Until the day I see you face to face, please accept my all-too-limited and human praise for all you have done to save me. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
