CONTENT: Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Proverbs 23:22
VERSE: Proverbs 23:22
THOUGHTS: "Honor your father and mother." This is basic to God's plan for our lives. When families are built within God's covenant of grace, respect and obedience by children toward their parents is a blessing to the children! As adults, we preserve the dignity of our parents and teach our children important life-lessons when we honor and respect them appropriately. Let's not get swept up in our era of parent-bashing. Let's bless our parents in ways that honor God. (If your parents were ungodly or abusive, find older folks in your church family for your emotional and spiritual support, while in as many ways as is possible treat your physical parents with honesty, respect, and integrity.) 
PRAYER: Loving Father and eternal God, thank you for my parents â€” physical and/or spiritual. Bless them with what they most need to find their way home to you. Give me wisdom to know how best to show my love and respect to them. Most of all, Father, please help them to see that my love and character come from you. In Jesus' name pray. Amen.
