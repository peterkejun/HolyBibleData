CONTENT: For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: 2 Peter 1:21
VERSE: 2 Peter 1:21
THOUGHTS: Where did Scripture come from? What is the basis of our faith in the Bible and the Gospel? Peter wants us to realize that the prophets of ancient times didn't bake up their own private recipes for their prophecies. Instead, they could only move and respond to what God was doing in them, not what they themselves wanted to do or say. They were human, but their message was God's word because the Holy Spirit moved them to speak and guided their words. This makes what we have in Scripture from the prophets more than precious: we are given the very words of God! (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16-17)
PRAYER: Almighty God, thank you for inspiring ordinary people to give us your extraordinary message in common, everyday language. Thank you for delivering that essential message to us in the Bible and preserving it through times of persecution, hardship, and opposition. Please use those same Scriptures to ignite a whole new revival in my heart and throughout our land. In the name of Jesus I pray. Amen.
