CONTENT: Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. 
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Hebrews 11:6
VERSE: Hebrews 11:6
THOUGHTS: Our relationship with God is built on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus and our acceptance of that sacrifice through obedient faith. That faith trusts that God not only exists, but that he also personally cares about us and our desire to know him. He eagerly longs to bless those who seek him. What we find when we seek him, however, is that all other blessings pale in comparison to knowing, and being known by the eternal, immortal, and only true God! 
PRAYER: Holy God, I do seek to know you better. Please make your presence known more powerfully in my life and in the life of your Church. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
