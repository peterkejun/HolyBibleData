VERSE DESCRIPTION: Nehemiah 9:5
VERSE: Nehemiah 9:5
THOUGHTS: God loves to hear our praises and songs of adoration. He longs to hear us call him Abba Father and King of the Ages. But better than all the praise we can muster and higher than the highest sounds of angels is something higher still: the very name of God. Let's make a commitment to revere and hold as holy the name of our glorious God!
PRAYER: Almighty God, Father of compassion and Creator of the Universe, I praise you for exerting your will on our world. Now, dear Father, please make your will clearly demonstrable in my life as I seek to live for you so that your name will be exalted. In the holy name of Jesus I pray. Amen.
