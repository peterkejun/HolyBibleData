CONTENT: Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
VERSE: Isaiah 6:8
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Isaiah 6:8
THOUGHTS: Church worship is not the goal of our life here on earth. As important as church worship and personal praise are, they are only part of our goal. We are here to glorify God with both our lips and our lives, with our hearts and our hands. With the world around us caught up in Satan's traps, God wants us to hear his call to us in our church and private worship and respond by saying, "Here am I. Use me!" Then he wants us to enter the world redemptively, making a difference in our "public worship" of ministry.
PRAYER: Loving God, Rock and Refuge of my soul, thank you for giving me the experiences I've had in my life. Thank you for the abilities you placed in me while you fashioned me in my mother's womb. Thank you for the gifts your Spirit molded in me when I became your child. Now, dear Father, please help me to know how and where I am to use these gifts in your Kingdom and to bless those in the world, so that I can help bring others to you, help build up the Body of Christ, and bless your people. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
