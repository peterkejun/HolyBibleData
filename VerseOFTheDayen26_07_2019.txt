CONTENT: Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Titus 2:3
VERSE: Titus 2:3
THOUGHTS: "Teach... to teach!" We need faithful women in God's family to help show us the way to reverence God in our daily lives and to live with character. That means we need to teach these women they need to teach. We need to pray for them to step forward and be mentors. We must openly respect their reverent lifestyles and acknowledge their godly character.
PRAYER: Holy and righteous Father, please raise up women of strong character and faithful service. Give us the eyes to see their godly lives and a willingness to hold them up as examples to your people. Thank you for the many godly women in our Christian heritage who have had tremendous impact for good â€” women like Deborah, Esther, Mary, Dorcas, and Priscilla. I also want to thank you for those godly women who have made such a great difference in my life and taught me so much about faith, hope, and love. In the name of Jesus I pray. Amen.
