Boxers martyr “Blind Chang” at Chaoyang, China. Formerly an alcoholic, thief, gambler, and gangster, he had become blind after abandoning his wife and forcing his daughter into prostitution. He made his way to a mission station where he heard the gospel and was transformed. He returned home to preach, braving thrown rocks and the dogs that villagers sicced on him. When missionaries checked on him, they found he had won 200 souls for Christ. After he learned Braille, he memorized Scriptures and won even more souls. When the Boxers came, Christians hid Chang. The Boxers rounded up fifty Christians in Chaoyang, but were told that as long as Chang lived, Christians would continue to multiply. The Boxers offered to free their captives in exchange for Chang. When told this, Chang volunteered to die in their place. The Boxers tried to force him to sacrifice to Buddha. When he refused, they beheaded him, then fled in terror, saying they had killed a righteous man.
