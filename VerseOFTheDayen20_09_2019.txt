CONTENT: [The apostle Paul said] "God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us."
VERSE DESCRIPTION: Acts 17:27
VERSE: Acts 17:27
THOUGHTS: Our seeking God longs to be sought! God placed his fingerprints all over the universe and then gave us places to find life and meaning. He had a purpose in this plan: he wanted us to seek the One behind it all. He is never far away from us, but he longs to be sought and found. When we seek after God, we are not only blessing him, we're also living out our life's key task.
PRAYER: Heavenly Father, I long to know you more completely â€” as the old hymn says to Jesus: "Beyond the sacred page, I seek thee Lord. My spirit pants for thee O living Word." Loving Father, I ask that your presence would be recognizable in my daily life. I truly want to get to know you, even as I am known by you. In the name of the Savior I pray. Amen.
