CONTENT: I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day...
VERSE DESCRIPTION: 2 Timothy 4:7-8
VERSE: 2 Timothy 4:7-8
THOUGHTS: I am so thankful for Paul's confidence as he faces his death. He is all but abandoned and is worried about the future of the Church, but he knows two things: he has served the Lord faithfully and the Lord will receive him when he dies! Shouldn't those two things be our most important goals in life? So if they are our goals, how do we live each day to fulfill them?
PRAYER: Faithful and loving God, you have so richly blessed me with salvation by your grace. Please strengthen me out of the riches of that grace. I am sometimes weak and falter in my faithfulness. I know your grace is lavish, but I don't want to presume on it or abuse it. Please give me strength and courage to live faithfully and passionately for you until the day I see you face to face and share with you in your glory and victory. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
