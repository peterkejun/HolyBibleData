VERSE DESCRIPTION: Genesis 1:1
VERSE: Genesis 1:1
THOUGHTS: We are creatures of the earth. Yes, we are much more than that, but occasionally we need to be reminded of that! We can't truly understand existence before time, yet before the beginning of time as we know it, God existed &#8212; he has revealed himself as "I Am," the one who was and who is and who is to come. Before there was an ordered universe to provide the basis of our existence, God is "I Am." He had existence before, beyond, and without our created universe. We can't even truly comprehend this in its entirety. That's why every new beginning &#8212; whether it is a day, a week, a year, or a millennium &#8212; should begin with God. He alone is the ultimate Genesis, our beginning.
PRAYER: Almighty Creator and God of all of the universe, I praise you for your incomparable power and your incomprehensible glory. As I begin this new year, I know that my future rests in your will, your grace, and your salvation. Please go with me as I journey toward this future. Please be glorified in the way I live my life today, this year, and for as long as you give me earthly life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
